            <h2>About me.</h2>
            <p>Nice to meet you! I'm a software engineer in the consumer banking space. 
              <ul>
                <li>I started my career as an SRE in 2018, where I learned a lot about monitoring & alerting frameworks, system integration, and incident detection & management. I also became proficient in Python, SQL, Splunk, Dynatrace, and Unix & shell scripting. In 2021 I moved to a development team working on Java applications in private-cloud and VSI environments.</li>
                <li>Here’s a little about me: I’m passionate about music, mathematics, great books, and linguistics. I love playing guitar and writing songs. I hate doing the same thing two days in a row. I’m an army brat who’s moved over 11 times throughout the US and Europe. I lived in Belgium during high school and became fluent in French. </li>
                <li>I am committed to constant learning, creativity, technical proficiency, and quality customer service. I’m happy when I’m working on products that people love in an agile, customer-obsessed environment.</li>
              </ul>
