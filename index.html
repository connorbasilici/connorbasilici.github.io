            <h3>A background of tech support, and development in the Consumer Banking space</h3>
            <ul> <!-- unordered list has the same color, font-family and size as paragraph-->
              <li>I started my career as an SRE in 2018, where I learned a lot about monitoring & alerting frameworks, system integration, and incident detection & management. I also became proficient in Python, SQL, Splunk, Dynatrace, and Unix & shell scripting. In 2021 I moved to a development team working on Java applications in private-cloud and VSI environments.</li>
              <li>Here’s a little about me: I’m passionate about music, mathematics, great books, and linguistics. I love playing guitar and writing songs. I hate doing the same thing two days in a row. I’m an army brat who’s moved over 11 times throughout the US and Europe. I lived in Belgium during high school and became fluent in French. </li>
              <li>I am committed to constant learning, creativity, technical proficiency, and quality customer service. I’m happy when I’m working on products that people love in an agile, customer-obsessed environment.</li>
